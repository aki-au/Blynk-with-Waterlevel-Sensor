# Blynk-with-Waterlevel-Sensor
A simple arduino code which sends water level sensor values to the Blynk App.


This Water level detection interface has been made to interpret the amount of water present on a surface and provide the various levels on an app so that it can be monitored.
It is a simple setup which is easy-to-use and can be used as a gauge of water levels in tanks, rainfall levels etc.
